Show HN: AI-Powered Documentation Generator for Legacy Codebases

I've built a tool that automatically generates comprehensive documentation for legacy codebases using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). As a former CIO who managed teams working with millions of lines of Visual Basic, Sybase, and Oracle Forms code, I feel the pain of  maintaining and onboarding developers to legacy systems.

The Problem:
- Legacy codebases are notoriously difficult to understand and navigate
- Onboarding new developers takes months
- Making changes safely requires deep institutional knowledge
- Business stakeholders lack visibility into system architecture

The Solution:
I've created an MCP-based tool that:
- Automatically scans your entire codebase
- Generates README files at each level of the directory structure
- Creates C4 architecture diagrams showing system components and relationships
- Builds a complete documentation hierarchy from high-level architecture to implementation details

The tool helps teams:
- Onboard developers faster with clear system documentation
- Make changes confidently with better understanding of components
- Communicate system architecture to stakeholders effectively
- Maintain living documentation that evolves with the codebase
